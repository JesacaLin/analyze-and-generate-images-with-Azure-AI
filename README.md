# Azure AI Vision and OpenAI Integration

This repository contains a web application that integrates computer vision capabilities using Azure AI Vision and Azure OpenAI cognitive services. 

## Project Overview

The challenge was to build a web application that leverages the power of AI to analyze and generate images. The application uses the latest Image Analysis 4.0 features, powered by Microsoftâ€™s Florence large foundation model, to analyze existing images. It also enriches the solution with generative AI capabilities to create new images from text descriptions.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: The application can analyze an existing image using Azure AI Vision's Image Analysis 4.0 features.
- **Image Generation**: The application can generate a new image from a text description using Azure OpenAI's generative AI capabilities.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Azure as a Static Web App. A CI/CD pipeline has been set up using GitHub Actions, which automatically builds and deploys the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, set up the necessary environment variables for Azure AI Vision and Azure OpenAI. Finally, start the application and open it in your web browser.
