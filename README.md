# 🚀  A Journey into AI-Powered Image Analysis and Generation with Azure AI Vision and OpenAI Integration!

This repository contains a web application that integrates computer vision capabilities using Azure AI Vision and Azure OpenAI cognitive services. 

## 🎯 Project Mission

The challenge was to build a web application that leverages the power of AI to analyze and generate images. The application uses the latest Image Analysis 4.0 features, powered by Microsoft’s Florence large foundation model, to analyze existing images. It also enriches the solution with generative AI capabilities to create new images from text descriptions.

## 🌟 Features

- **Image Analysis**: The application can analyze an existing image using Azure AI Vision's Image Analysis 4.0 features.
- **Image Generation**: The application can generate a new image from a text description using Azure OpenAI's generative AI capabilities.

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is deployed on Azure as a Static Web App. A CI/CD pipeline has been set up using GitHub Actions, which automatically builds and deploys the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Link available upon request.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To embark on this journey, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and set up the necessary environment variables for Azure AI Vision and Azure OpenAI.
